Using Python 3.

Things that I am working on.

Made a structure change to the branch.

Sections:
    Scraping data from various sites.
    Keeping the Maths section for future scripts.
    The Networking section needs to be consolidated into more useful scripts.
    Weather section no longer uses a supported API.. Looking for options.

Added a text file to each section stating purpose and future plans.
Am going to focus on how to implement python into my job.

Will use Python as a wrapper for trying bug bounties.
Will use it to automate.
